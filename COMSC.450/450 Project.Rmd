```{r, include=FALSE}

#function to convert the letter grades to numeric values
letter_to_number <- function(x){
  
  #I have to use ifelse rather than else if because the input is a vector
  ifelse(x=="A", 4.00, 
  ifelse (x=="A-", 3.67,
  ifelse (x=="B+", 3.33,
  ifelse (x=="B", 3.00,
  ifelse (x=="B-", 2.67,
  ifelse (x=="C+", 2.33,
  ifelse (x=="C", 2.00,
  ifelse (x=="C-", 1.67,
  ifelse (x== "D+", 1.33,
  ifelse (x=="D", 1.00,
  ifelse (x== "F",0.00, x)))))))))))
  
  
}

```

## First, I load the data into a dataframe in r called allData

```{r warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}

#file containing all the groups goes here
allGroups <- 'AllGroups.txt'

#create the data frame with a row of data to not get null errors when adding rows later
allData <- data.frame(Group = c(0),
                      Section = c(0),
                      Data = c(0)
                      )

#variable used to skip the first line in the files since they contain titles, m and o have the same function
n <- 1

#read all the groups from the original file
for (group in readLines(allGroups)){ #input top file here
  if(n>1){
    m<- 1
    
    #read all the sections from the group files
    for (section in readLines(group)){
      if(m>1){
       o <- 1
      
       #read all the data from the section files
       for(data in readLines(section)){
         if(o>1){
           
           #add all the data to the data frame
           allData[nrow(allData)+1,] = c(group, section, data)
         }
         o <- o+1
       }
      }
      m<-m+1
  }}
  n <- n+1
}

```

```{r}
#preview the beginning of the table
head(allData)

```

## Now I reformat the data in the table to the way I want it

```{r warning=TRUE, include=FALSE}

#remove first row
allData <- allData[-c(1), ]

#separate the data using a comma as a separator
allData <- separate(allData, col=Data, into=c("email", "lname", "fname", "grade"), sep=",")

#combine the first and last names
allData <- unite(allData, col = "name", c('lname', 'fname') , sep=', ')

#convert letter grades to numbers
allData$grade <- letter_to_number(allData$grade)

#convert grade to proper data type
allData$grade <- as.numeric(as.character(allData$grade))

```

```{r}
#preview the beginning of the table
head(allData)

```

## Here is the data analysis comparing each section to its group

```{r warning=FALSE, include =FALSE}

diffSections = list()
#variable used to skip the first line in the files since they contain titles, m and has the same function
n <- 1
#read all the groups from the original file
for (group in readLines(allGroups)){ #input top file here
  if(n>1){
    m<- 1
    #read all the sections from the group files
    for (section in readLines(group)){
      if(m>1){
        #do t.test between all grades for the current section compared to all grades in the current group
        test <- t.test((allData$grade[allData$Section==section & allData$Group == group]), allData$grade[allData$Group == group])$p.value
    
       if(test < 0.05){
         #add sections that are significantly different so that we can easily print them
         diffSections <- c(diffSections, section)
       }
        
      }
      m<-m+1
    }
  }
  n <- n+1
}


```

These sections have significantly different grades from the group

```{r}
print(diffSections)
```
